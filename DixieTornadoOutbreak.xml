of tin wreckage of yesierday's torna

The tornadoes lasted altogether
about 12 hours striking promiscuously

t rawling cautiously out of the torna
do districts, leaving behind one town
J'urvis, Miss., utterly demolished;
five others practically blown away
and llfteen little villages in more or
less acute stage of ruin.
With these wounded came details
of one of the worst disasters in the
history of the gulf states.
First of allf it became known that
negro comprised the moat of the
dead, most -of their deaths occurring
In Itimsy cabins, and the most badly
wounded came from" the same
places.
Th" identified white dead early to-
clay numbered 42. In addition it Is

nearly twenty towns were struck by

to number of victims ami territory
overed. Although It traveled through
a rural district and struck no Kirge
towns the known results of Its work
are f. 4 dead 'and at least 100 injured
with the prospect that the list wlTT be
considerably swtdled Moro than 50
of the dead are negroes whose log
cabins proved particularly fatal to
the oceupunts, being easily torn to
pieces while the weight of the tim
bers crushed the Inmates to death.
Alter leaving Concordia Parish the
storm crossed over into Mississippi j
and traversed portions of Adams,
Jefferson and 4. la bourne counties. Its
path being about 1.000 feet wide.

New Orleans, April 25.--Probably
half a thousand lives lost, a hundred
o; more persons fatally injured and
many times this number painfully
hurt, together with a property loss
running into the millions, is the rec
ord so far of a tornado that originated
in the west two days ago, sweeping
Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Tennes
see, Alabama and Georgia. .It has
left a path of death, desolation and
want in its. wake, seriously interrupt
ed all communication between cities
ii the south, and bro'ught chaotic con
ditfons in many shaller towns.
Mississippi, already, a sufferer from
more than one tornado this year, has
again borne the brunt of the winds
and rains. Estimates of the number
of those who. lost their lives in that
state place the death list near 300,
wlth a thousand or more injured.
Appeal to Governor.
In Texas, Louisiana, Alabama and
Georgia, the lists are also large, with
serious loss of life in Arkansas and
Tennessee. In half. a dozen commun
ities martial law has been declared,
so terrible was the destruction and
so helpless were the stricken people
left by the disaster. Serious disorders
have occt red in some places, includ
ing Amite, La., looting' and other
crimes have been reported, but these
inttances have been, on the whole,
rare.
Several places have issued appeals
for aid and in Mississippi Governor
Noel has been asked to provide tents
for the homeless.
Travels Eastward.
The tornadoes lasted in all a period'
of nearly two days. It was Thurs
day night that damage by tornadoes
traveling. eastward was first' reported
from points in Texa's. This was fol
lowed during the next 24 hours ,by
similar reports from Arkansas, Louis
fana, Mississippi and Tennessee.
Last night Alabama came within the
flight of the sto'rm and today reports
of serious damage by the winds in
Georgia have been recorded.
Utter misery of every sort was
found 'today at Purvis, Miss., by re
lief parties. Despite the fact that
of the 2,500 inhabitants which this
little town boasted yesterday morn-'
ing, there were only 900 today; still,
there were not sufficient accopidda

wounded: Negro mammies and little
black children lay wounded and help;
less under the broiling sun. 'Some
had -broken bones, some were partly
crushed and others had been wounded
by sticks and splinters.
Blanket a Luxury.
These unfortunates -Were lucky if
they had a blanket or a storm-wricked
couch upon which to rest. There was
lot enough shelter in thie town to pro
tedt them from'the,sun and many of
the walls which remained standinmg
had no roofs and by a queer freak of
the tornado, many of the trees which
had not been uprooted had been
snatched off a few feet above the

as if a giant scythe had swept through.

	<text>Tempestuous Weather
The weather this spring has not been ■
calm and normal although it has as a
rule been pretty good for the growing j
crops. There has been an element in
it, however, tnat bred tempests and i
tornadoes, and scarcely any change in |
it has been free from dangerous winds.
The storm that swept over four states 1
in the last days of April‘will be long |
remembered, and besides that great j
storm weekly, if not daily', hurricanes
have visited some part of Dixie Land.
Few tornadoes have been reported
in the northwest or central west, and
for some reason not clearly or fully i
explained the south has been this year j
the chief theatre of winds and violent !
storms. These eccentricities of nature !
will soon, let us hope, subside and
cease altogether to be. We do not ‘
need any more this year. The spring !
of 1908 has already made a storm rec- j
ord, and it should be content to rest on [
its abnormality by letting normal
weather return to this section of the
country.</text>

	<text>New Orleans, April 25.—Tha dead
more than 300, the Injured at least
1,000 the3e are the grim facts which
came to light when the wreckage
of the tornado in Georgia, Louisiana,
Mississippi and Alabama had been
cleared away. The tornadoes lasted
altogether about twelve hours, strik­
ing promiscuously one town after the
other. Many hours after they struck
trains bearing nearly 200 Injured came
crawling cautiously out of tha tor­
nado districts, leaving behind them
one town, Purvis, Miss., utterly de­
molished, five others practically blown
away and forty little villages in
more or less acute stages of ruin.
With these wounded came the details
of one of the worst wiud disasters in
the history of the Gulf states.
First of all it became known that
negroes comprised most of the dead,
that the picturesque darky cabins,
noted for their flimsy, happj' go lucky
construction, had been converted by
the wind into wholesale death traps.
It was in the fall of these cabins,
which went down almost without
warning, that most of the negro deaths
occurred. These always overcrowded
cabins also furnished most of the
badly wounded.
The destruction of Purvis, Miss.,
was complete in a few minutes time.
Of about 200 dwelling houses only
seven were left standing. The court­
house, the only other building in town
to withstand the wind, was immedi­
ately packed with dead and injured
and served as the only available hos­
pital within many miles.
Amite, La., Under Martial Law.
Amite, La., was so badly damaged
that it was put under martial law by
order of its mayor. The storm killed
two white persons and thirteen ne­
groes outright and injured many oth
ers, mostly negroes, so badly 'that
physicians say the total death list of
Amite would reach at least twenty
live. Rev. Father Felix Rumpf was
possibly the first person killed. He
was in the bell tower of his church,
having just finished ringing the bell.
He was crushed to death by the fall­
ing tower.
The path of the tornado was about
two and a half miles wide and when
It had passed Amite stood a wreck.
Large numbers of farm animals were
killed.
Forty-six towns report serious
wreckage by the storm, in which 2,
500 business houses and habitations
were laid in ruins. The following is
a list by sfites of the forty-six towns
reporting more or less damage:
Louisiana—Lucerne, Kenmore, La
inourle, Richland, Amtte, Essie, Pine,
Angle, Franklinton, Sheridan, Avard,
Eunice. Total, twelve.
Mississippi—Gilles Bend, Purvis,
Churchill, Lorman, Tillman, Malton,
Baxterviiie, Braxton, Sunflower, Wa­
halak, Wingate, Columbus, Walls,
Fairchilds Creek, Quitmana Landing,
McLaurin, McCallum, Winchester,
Pine Ridge. Total, nineteen.
