	<text>PASTORS CANT COMPETE WITH
CHARLEY CHAPLIN
Milwaukee, Nov. 4. "Charlie
Chaplin" sermons were called "im
possible" by the Rev. Samuel H.
Woodrow of St Louis in speaking be
fore the Woman's Board of Missions
of the Interior, which closed here to
day. "There has been much talk about
making sermons interesting," said
the speaker. "We never can make
sermons as interesting as melo
dramas or prayer meetings as amus
ing as Charlie Chaplin. They never
were meant to be so.
"If a heathen dropped into New
York and saw a church with a seating
capacity of 1,500, attended by about
200 on Sunday and dark six days a
week, he would never go back with
the impression that the United States
was a Christian nation."</text>

	<text>RIVALRY BETWEEN MOVIE MEN
Charlie Chaplin, highest paid
actor in the world, is appearing
at the Melbourne and Liberty to
day in the same picture, "His
First Vacation.'' Never before
has the same actor appeared in
the same picture at two Tacoma
movies at the same time.
It is an evidence of the keen
rivalry between movie men. The
Melbourne had signed the film
for next week. The Liberty, how
ever, obtained the same picture
for the latter half of this week.
Manager Sumni**rville of the Mel
bourne telegraphed a hurry-up
order for his film yesterday when
he heard of the Libertys' move,
and obtained his copy of tlie film
by express yesterday. He put it
on his bill at 4 p. ni. without an-
Tlie picture remains at both
houses until tomorrow night.
CHAPLIN AT
LIBERTY
The old favrolte — Charlie
Chaplin—who has returned to
the IJberty.
Movie fans who see Charlie
Chaplin this week at the Liberty
will not only see the world's
greatest comedian in action, after
a long vacation, but will witness
the work of a man who gets
$670,000 a year for being foolish.
Chaplin recently signed with Mu
tual at this price. His Liberty
film, "His First Vacation," is
added to the regular bill of "The
Innocence of Ruth,' a clever
;crook drama.

ILANCHE SWEET
IS AT LIBERTY
Blanche Sweet, idol of millions of
followers of the silent drama, is al
ways assured a warm welcome at the
liberty theater the -Home of Para
mount Pitcures," and. of necessity the
stopping off place of Blanche Sweet
while in Honolulu. Twice welcome
is thi3 star when in the east is an
other star also a favorite of Ions
standing with the select Liberty au
diences. Thomas Mcighan appears in
the current feature at this theater,
"The Silent Partner." as co-star with
Blanche Sweet and the combination is
one that it would be hard to beat.
"The Silent Partner" is one of those
kind of dramas that always appear to
have teen especially written for Miss
Sweet. It affords her an opportunity
to turn from tears to sunshine as she
alone knowns how. It is a powerful
drama with business loyalty as its
foundation and tells of a faithful steno
grapher and her successful efforts to
save her employer from financial destruction.

remain in Honolulu for a short time,

almost a permanent fixture. Provided

As the Mauna Kea pulled into thqi

Capturing Charlie Chaplin
By Harriette Underhill
Once upon a time we did not love
Charlie Chaplin. It was not so long
ago, either?not more than two years?
and it was when all movie houses re?
leasing his pictures had those horrible
wooden effigies of him in the lobby.
This may have helped to prejudice us.
At any rate, we used to glory in the
story of the nice old lady who went tim?
idly up to the box office and said: "Ex?
cuse me, "but is Charlie Chaplin's pict?
ure showing here?" "Yes, ?madam," re?
plied the box office man. "Going on at
2 o'clock." "Thank you," replies the
n. o. 1. "Then I won't go in." We al?
ways quoted that nice old lady and
never felt that we were really under?
stood unless we could find some one to
talk to who didn't like Charlie, either.
This was not so difficult at first, but
we felt that we were rapidly losing our
very best supporters, and hardly a day
passed but some one of them went over
to the pro-Charlies. Then along came
Heywood Broun, "our favorite dramatic
critic," saying that Charlie Chaplin was
screamingly funny and an artist. We
began to weaken.
First we went to see a Chaplin pict?
ure with an unbiassed mind. Then we
went to see another one voluntarily,
and then we fell to wondering how long
we must wait for the next to be re?
leased.
Four days ago we saw Charlie Chap?
lin talking to a man in front of Clar
idge'8, and we became incoherent with
excitement. It was the first time we
ever had seen him off the screen, and
we were immediately stricken with in
terviewitis. Stage and screen persons
have come to be merely subjects. They
are good, bad or indifferent?mostly in?
different?but Charlie was a prize not
to bo ignored.
The fact that he was avoiding pub?
licity and had refused to see all inter?
viewers made the thing so much more
interesting. The most he could do
would be to deny his identity and say:
"Madam, how daro you! I am not that
sort of person." But fortunately his
countenance was not as inscrutable as
that of the hotel clerk up at the Ritz,
where Charlie has his modest little
three rooms and five baths. But more
of that hotel clerk later.
At any rate, we decided to sacrifice
everything on the altar of duty, so we
went straight up to the great and only
Charles and just as we were about to
pluck him by the sleeve and say, "Ex?
cuse me, Mr. Chaplin, I'm the person
who has been writing such nice things
about you," we discovered ?hat the
man he. was talking to was the man
who writes the second best movie re?
views in town.
Of course, even with a proper intro?
duction it was a bit disconcerting ?to
meet your screen idol so suddenly,
without his shoes or his cane or his
hat, and yet we knew him immediately.
Wo apologized for the interruption,
mentally deciding that wild horses
couldn't drag us away until we had had
a chance to find out just how Charlie
Chaplin talked, how he thought, how
he dressed and how he looked.
He talks humorously, he thinks se?
riously, he dresses quietly and he
looks handsome. He has the whitest
teeth we ever saw, the bluest eyes and
the blackest eyelashes. "How did you
know me?" inquired Mr. Chaplin
naively. "Why, you look just like your
pictures," wo answered truthfully.
"Not my pictures on the screen, I
hope?" said Charlie. "Oh, no," said
we. "But, you know, occasionally one
does see a photograph of you in a
magazine." "Oh, I see," said Charlie.
"Such is fame." And then we said
pleadingly, "Won't you please let us
interview you?" To which he replied:
"You know, I haven't seen a person
nor talked to any one, but if you'll
promise not to say anything about my
work for the government, why?all
right."
He looked terribly suspicious. Just
as though we were not taking more of
a chance than he was. Hadn't we seen
him drop ice cream down a lady's neck
and get her involved in a revolving
door and trip her up with his cane?
And how could we tell what moment
he might pull a dog out of his. trousers
pocket or drop an egg out of his hat on
our new suit?
But he told us that he never again
would pull a dog out of his trousers
pocket, because Mutt, who co-starred
with his master in "A Dog's Life," is
dead, and no other ever shall take his
place. When Charlie came East he
left Mutt behind, and to, being only a
dog, Mutt refused to forget his beloved
friend. He starved himself to death
and was buried on the 29th of April.
"Every one told Mutt that I would
Burely return, but perhaps he didn't
understand, or perhaps he didr?'t be?
lieve them. At any rate, he never would
] eat after the last time I fed him, and
the inscription on his tombston^ reads:
'Mutt, died April 29?a broken heart.'"
We talked to Mr. Chaplin for an
hour, and then he suddenly remem?
bered that he had to go out and make
a speech on the subject which we
promised not to mention. And he told
us about how much better he likes the
West than he does the East, and ad?
mitted that he could play the 'cello
and the violin and the piano, and thst
he had worked for two-and-six a week
in London, and that he didn't know
why people laughed at him, and how
he first walked his famous walk. The
other things which we learned about
Chaplin are probably known to every
one who knows Charlie.</text>

NO recent case of broken romance and

such Interest as the suit for

(In an interview) <
I AM quite ready to admit that my marriage
to Charlie Chaplin was a mistake.
It was a mistake on his part, because
he is a genius, and geniuses should not
I knarry. He would better be free and remain
free, for he will make any 'woman he
marries miserable, I know. J
I We have been married for three years.

from Mt. Lowe, and Mr. Chaplin had been
away so long, and when he came back he
said it would do me good to go to New
York, so I wentt with her. But he wouldn't
give me but $150.'and when I got East r
bought a lot of baby clothes ad some baby

Famous Movie Comedian says
London He Knew as Boy
Does Not Exist Now
BY CHARLIE CHAPLIN
LONDON, Oct. 1. I always figure
America under the symbol of youth
vigorous, aggressive, full of hope and
pen. courageous, and with the sun
light of the morning shining in its
eyes.
I find England more like a serene
old age mellowed by time, softened
ly suffering, wise from long experi
ence and with the. afterglow of the
westering sun in its eyes.
America, like all youth, has a core
of hardness in its heart.
England, like all mellowed old age
has a core of tenderness in its heart.
I should say America for work,
England for thoughtful contempla
tion and dreams. ,
Of course, I know England is one of
the mightiest nations in the world;
that its hardy sons rule an empire;
that they sail all seas and traffic In
all markets. But I am merely trying
to give my own impressions, to tell
how the two countries 'affect me.
I don't think I could do much work
in England. Everything Is so finish
ed, so settled, so restful that it would
simply absorb' me.
America Is Restless
nut there Is in America a feeling of
the unfinished, of restlessness that
ius. makes one want to get up and do
thjngs. That is why I am going back
In a few weeks.
It's all very nice to say that Chap
lin brings laughter to men, but the
truth is that Chaplin is working for
his bread and cheese just like the
rest of you. There is not much fun
jn loafing too long.
' I have been rediscovering England
for myself aiyl contrasting my Im
pressions of America and also with
my memeories of the England I knew
as a boy.
' I came to America when I was 18
und In the past 14 years have only
been back home once. .
My best experience has been to ram
ble around the streets in the poor
sections of London that I 'used
know. I found in the mean streets
something very lovely, something spir
itunl. I nian as regards the people.
There they were, living in misera
ble ( tenements, their faces thin and
pinehed from poor food, and yet there
w something very beautiful in their
eye.
I. have never seen anything sweeter
than the expression in the face of a
girl out walking with her coster Tcrer.
I began to understand how these
poor people had suffered during the
long years of the war and how thev
had found the pluck to do it. and 1
saw the mak rit had left on them. It
was saddening as well as beautiful to
get these -revelations.
Had "Emotional Jag"
Then I had an emotional jag. I
prowled these poor streets in search
or a wistful little bov I used to know
a little, ill-dressed, rather fright
ened Charlie Chaplin.
Somehow. I couldn't quite catch up
with him. The streets all seemed nar
rower to me than they did to that
little chap, and the crowds not quite
so big and bustling, and the policemen
not quite so terrifying.

CHARLIE CHAPLIN . ,
But I did see something we haven't
got in America. eaw the mark Iof
class distinction. The population In
England Is really subdivided into real
classes and castes. And being a very
I old civilization and a very crowded
country, it is hard for a man to get
ou of his class.
We have none of that in America.
The workman of today still has the
chance to be the captain of, industry
of tomorrow. Why, the poor editor of
yesterday is the president of today!
America" is still in thd construction
stage. She is not finished. That i
why the builders, who are at work on
the structure today, should be so very
careful.
It seems to me, looking back
across the waters and across time,
that America Is in a very critical pe
riod. 1
Finance is once, more in danger of
falling into the 1 bands of the few we
always call "Wall Street."
And finance is adapting a taa Intol
erant attitude toward labor. Labor
should not be -asked to do all the giv
ing un. Finance should give up a lit

too much clash, a class feeling will

I think "another danger to America
is the number 'of organizations which
are growing up which are anti-some-bodyq,
anti-some religion or race or
creed or free expression of thought.
America can learn a lesson in this
regard from old England. There is
far greater personal liberty and far
greater iibertv of speech in England
than in America. .

whom Chaplin identifies himself and
with whom the world of respectabilities

Chaplin expresses for us an imaginary
escape from this conflict and he does
it by resolving it into a joke.

is in this world but not of it. Chaplin
bowl this secret and reveals it in
Iiiis hook.
Gar!...' Chaplin's book is from the
psychological angle a remarkable hu?
man document, greatly because of this
revelation. It explains the appeal of
this poor little feeble creature on the
outglde of the great big world. To the
reade?r unversed in psychology the
outstanding features of the book are
likely to be the triumphant return of
Charlie Chaplin to the land of his birth
his meetings with the great in poli?
tics and letters his sympathy for the
unfortunate his intimate confessions
of his likes and dislikes. However, the
real revelation lies in Charlie's visits
to the haunts of his childhood.
Trio whole tone of the book is that
of a half lonely ?'dventurer visiting the
scene:; of his early 1 i fr. reacting with
genuine sympathy to every situation.
We learn of Chaplin's early experi?
ence as a little ragged urchin. On top
of that, experience has been imposed
this magical thing- for his succ?s?? has
been like an Arabian Nights fantasy?
and 1 doubt if he has ever quite real?
ized tha' ?t vvas he who has had it.
This little ragged urchin has stayed
v.ith Chaplin all his life and is the
main reason for his tremendous hu?
man appeal.
? ? ?
OUR or five years ago ?ome neigh?
bor child came rushing to me, all
out of breath. She was all excited, for
she was going to the Hippodrome to see
"Charlie Chaplin himself.'' ?
At thar time "Charlie Chaplin him-'
self didn't mean any more to me than !
Charlie in the, movies. But after read?
ing his book T feel that I do know
Charlie Chaplin himself. In another
age. where he would have had to ap
pear directly in person before his
audiences, the chances are that the
personal side of his art would have
been more evident to the people, who
are rather inclined to look down on
the movies, anyhow, and who have re?
garded Charlie Chaplin merely as a
comedian who makes lots of money.
The motion picture ,is a medium of
expression is a syndicate sort of thing.
It takes a tremendous amount of per?
sonality to overcame the?" difficulties.
] !. ? crowds who have bce'n rooting for
Chaplin have been psychologically cor?
rect. 'While he has an enormous popu?
larity, he doesn't make an appeal to
the crowd mind, but rather a secret
h -?stance to civilization which is in us
nil. and he does it because at heart he
is really the littlo ragged ur?jhin?the
vagabond adventurer.</text>

Cried Pola Negri in Tragic Earnestness.
SCARCELY two years since Charlie Chaplin
was divorced from Mildred Harris, is
wife, and now his new romance wi
German-Pole film star, Pola Negri, is clou e
with trouble.
The Polish nobleman, Count Dombski, has
heard the news where he happens now to be in
England and has announced that Pola Negri is
still his wife and that Charlie Chaplin must face
him in a duel if he dares to marry Pola Negri.
It would be a strange sight if the motion
picture audiences could see the fiery Count
Dombski rush forward, sword in hand, to make
the great film comedian answer to him on the
field of honor. But the threatened duel is hardly
likely to happen where the movie cameras can photograph it.
x Charlie Chaplin is very handy with that cane of his. Is it
possible that Mr. Chaplin would take a humorous view of the
wild-eyed Polish Count and would give him a lesson in fencing
with his cane? z ~
The film audiences have seen Mr. Chaplin wiggle away from
all sorts of threatening situations and,-again and again, that
handy cane has tripped up policemen and detectives and big
bullies. But that was on the screen. What would Charlie do
rn a real life encounter with Count Dombski and his sharp-edged
S "°ln the recent news from the interesting lovers Pola Negri
has sebmed to be rather more demonstrative than Mr. Chaplin.
The expressions that have come from the comedian have seemed
to be rather conservative, as if, perhaps, he had some anxieties
or misgivings in the back of his nead. Has Charlie Chaplin re
ceived a warning that he will be held to account on the field of
honor if he takes Pola Negri as a bride?
Pola Negri is a very attractive woman, and it is not surpris
ing that a man who was lucky enough to once possess her would
fight valiantly not to lose her. Very little has been revealed as
to the exact facts of Pola Negri’s marriage to Count Dombski, or
just when, where, and under what circumstances the divorce
was secured which Pola Negri relies upon to make it possible
for her to marry Charlie Chaplin.
But the interview quoted above with Count, Dombski was
secured by a British newspaper, and if Count Dombski makeg
good his threat to come to America and require an accounting
at the hands of Charlie Chaplin, a very interesting situation
will develop.
Whether Count Dombski is now cn his way to America to
settle things with the film comedian and his runaway wife has
not been announced. It is possible that Count Dombski may
be arranging his affairs in a leisurely manner and may not
arrive until after the marriage takes place.
Whatever Count Dombski may be planning to do, there is

That She Is Still His Wife.
little doubt that the Polish nobleman is a man of vigorous per
sonality and violent manner. He is an excellent swordsman and
a very good shot with the pistol.
Pola Negri herself, in telling of her romance and carriage
to Count Dombski, explains that he was so violently opposed to
having his wife continue working in the studios that he forbade
her to go on with her contracts with the Berlin movie producers.
“The parting of the ways came one night a few months
.after we were married,” she said, “when I was making one of
my periodic stays at Count Dombski’s castle at Sassnowiece, in
Poland. A telegram arrived about midnight, calling me back to
the Berlin studio, and when I showed it to my husband he flew
into a violent rage.
“Drawing his revolver, he told me that if I left for Berlin
it would be over his dead body. Knowing how he felt about the
matter, I recalled that the climax had been reached and that he
might do something desperate. So I told him 1 would remain.
“But that night, after he had gone to sleep, I got up and
dressed and, taking only such clothes as I could carry in my
arms, I left the castle, never to return.
“How I reached the railway station at Sassnowiece after my
escape is still a mystery to me. I must have walked and run
miles in the darkness. But my mind was made up—my career
came first, cost what it may. And, as luck would have it, there
was a train for Berlin almost ready to depart when I arrived
at the station —the spot where our romance had begun nearly
a year before.” ...
The lady who says she is no longer Countess Dombski, and is
eager to be Mrs. Charles Chaplin, is most emphatic on the
points at issue between her and the Count. “I deny that I
am the wife of the Count, and I challenge him to try to assert
his supposed rights in any court in the world. I have the
proper decree dissolving the marriage,” she insists.
“I am told that it is in proper form in all respects, and
that there is nothing to bind me to the Count. I am as free
as ever I,was, and he cannot stop me marrying the man of

my choice. “I repeat. lam free! free I free! to marry th* ftflHl
of my choice.
“Charlie and I love each other. We are made for eatfl
other, and we intend to seek happiness together < until death '
alone parts us. .Charlie sought me out among the artists of tho
world, and helped me to achieve greater fame than 1 enjoyed
up to then. We found that we were not only soul mates, but
that we had the temperament in our art that made tho one
Tthe complement of the other, and we both think that In associa
tion we can achieve our greatest and best work.”
At Los Angeles she appears everywhere Charlie is to bo
seen, and goes around with the triumphant air of the woman
in possession who will not surrender her rights to the film
artist under any circumstances.
“There is no law that can keep us apart,” she says. “Wo
are masters of. our own fate, and we shall not be prevented
from uniting our lives by ahy one. I love only Charlie in tho
world. He is my ting among men, and I will marry him in
spite of everything and everybody who tries to come between
us all.”
Mr. Chaplin is less defiant, and at times has the appearance
of being uncomfortable under the aggressive manner in which
he is claimed as her- affinity by the lady who seems to have
discovered in him the perfect lover immediately after he found
in her the perfect film star.
Mlle. Pola Negri, when questioned regarding the suggestion
that she as a Roman Catholic could hardly claim the right to
remarry after divorce, replied rather vaguely:
“On that there is a good deal of misunderstanding. I can
only tell you that I have taken the best -advice from legal and
spiritual advisers, and there is no real barrier to our marriage
if we decide to go through with it. •
“Fate brought Charlie and' me into contact, and we should
be foolish to run pway from our happiness decreed by fate.
He was on his way back to America when he was shown a
film in which I appeared.
“He said to,the person who showed the film, ‘Why, this is
the artiste I have been looking for since I first went into the
film business.’ I received a telegram soon after asking if I
would meet him.
“I did not know him except by name, and I did not think
I should like him, so I said ‘No.’ But in spite of that he came
and I realized at once that he was altogether different to what
I had expected, for not only was he a great actor but he was
a real man in every sense of the word.
“I found myself won over by his charming manners, and I
felt that I had at last found the man to whose keeping I could
surrender, my heart, my life, and my future happiness without
hesitation. Working with him makes a great deal of difference
to me.
“I feel that I can give a better expression to my heart
under his eyes, and for his sake I try to surpass anything I
have ever done before. I used to think that Charlie was fust
what you call a clown, with no art and no message, but now I
know that behind his clowning there is a real art and a real
message, if only those who see nis films would understand them.
“Charlie seeks to portray the- life of ‘Les of
the great cities and to arouse the comfortable classes to their
duties and responsibilities to the less fortunate.”
The story of the beginning of the Chaplin-Negri romance
is very interesting.
Charlie was shown some, of the films of the lady in London
and again in Paris. He liked them so well that he must needs
rush to Berlin and then to Vienna to see the artiste for himself.
“A veritable queen of the movies, the most perfect acting
features I ever seen, capable of expressing every con
ceivable shade of emotion with the skill and grace of the true
artiste,” he exclaimed.
These were among the eulogies passed by Charlie on the
lady as an artiste, but later he had something to say of her as
a worn in, as a beauty, and as a charmer of hearts. * She has
all the qualities of form and soul that fit a woman to reign
over the heart of a man and to be his greatest inspiration in
whatever he regards as his life work,” he declared. I
And Pola Negri was no less lavish in what She said of
Charlie. “A man that any woman could love, could work with
as life partner, and feel honored in doing so, finding her true
happiness in association with his life.,” she declared.
“He has the true soul of an artiste and is an ideal lover
with the capacity for making even the most capricious woman
happy,” were among the things she said of him, and after
this semi-public love-making, it was only to be expected that
the rapturous crowds of admirers should be eager to lead the
happy pair to the altar in order that their lives might be united
for better or for worse. . . . ,
Will Count Dombski cool off and let things take their course
or will he turn up in America and ask Charlie Chaplin to meet
him on the field of honor? And then what?

	<text>NATIONAL APPLE SHOW
At Spokane Nov. 20 to 25 Will Be
One Round of Hilarity
Spokane, Wash.,, Nov. B.—Starting
off with the famous $20,000 movie
scream “Tillie’s Punctured Romance,”
the free moving picture show at the
National Apple show November 20 to
26 will furnish a continuous round
of hilarity. The management of the
show after weeks of mnegotiations,
letter writing and telegraphing has
booked up the choicest bits of Charley
Chaplin fun and frolic that have ever
been thrown upon a screen, but per
haps the greatest of these will be
“Tillie’s Punctured Romance,” which
will be the big feature opening day

This film has been made famous
not only by the tens of thousands
who have laughed at it till their sides
ached, but also by the fact that, if
such a thing is possible, it is the
only film wherein Charley Chaplin
has been out starred, and that by a
mere woman. Charley wouldn’t have
been out shown then if it hadn’t been
that Marie Dressler, who plays the
part of Tillie, resorted to the courts
to recover $20,000 damages for injur
ies to various parts of her anatomy
sustained while depicting Tillie.
But Charley Chaplin will reign su
preme in the National Apple Show
movie. TFor five days this clown of
clowns will cut up capers, but on
Thursday he’ll be driven from the
footlights and then it will be Annette
Kellerman in ‘“Neptune’s Daughter,’
probably the most spectacular piece
ever photographed. This is the film
tbat was made in Bermuda, where the
mermwtids sport in the water, with
its wonderful water scenic effects and
marveious underwater pictures. Run
ning companion to Charley Chaplin
for four days will be two reels of
animated cartoons, with two new reels
each day. This moving picture’ show
will be absolutely free with a com
plete change of program every day.
The program ‘for the Apple Show
week follows:
Monday, November 20th: :
Charley Chaplin and Marie Dressler
in “Tillie’s Punctured Romance.”
Tuesday, November 21st:
Charlie Chaplin in “Work.”
Animated Cartoons.
Wednesday, November 22nd:

Pie giver, who is to have charge of
the free apple pie distribution at the
Ninth National Apple show in Spo
kane, November 20 to 25, walked in
to the office of Gordon C. Corbaley,
manager of the Apple Show.
“I'm getting ready for the apple
pies and I'd like to have a little
appropriation,” remarked Hannam.
“Alright, what do you want?”’ ask
ed Corbaley.
“In the first place I want six tons
of the choicest apples we can get.”
“How much?’ asked Corbaley, as
he leaned back in his chair and star
ed at the prodigal Hannam.
“Six tons, and good ones too,” re
peated Hannam.
“Say, are you trying to put the
whole ‘apple crop of the United Sta
tes into apple pies to be given away?”
asked Corbaley.
“You said a pie for every one who
comes to the show, didn’t you, and
as often as they come?”’ asked Han
nam,
“You bet and that goes, too, even to
babies,” replied Corbaley.
“Well here are the figures,” said
Hannam. “Figure it out yourself.”
Corbaley did. He figured it twice,
because he couldn’t believe it the first
time. When he got through he ac
cepted Hannam’s figures for all the
rest.
“You're right,” he said, as he put
his 0. K. to a voucher that read some
thing like this: ‘
Six tons of choice apples. -
Four tons of flour. :
One and one-half tons of lard.
One half tons of sugar.
Two hundred pounds of salt.
“And all that’s going into. apple
pies and they’ll all be given away at

	<text>CHARLEY CHAPLIN CONTEST ON MONDAY
\o HAS NOW MADE HER PHOTOPLAY DEBUT AND SAYS SHE LOVES IT,
The many New Hope and Lambertville friends of the latter’s Strand
Theatre will be much interested in the announcement that Flemington,
the county seat of Hunterdon, will soon have a handsome theatre to be
named “The Strand,” as soon as a site is selected. Messrs. Hildinger
and Papier, owners of the “The Strands” of Lambertville and Doylestown
and numerous other theatres throughout the state, have been in confer
ence with A. B. Lare of Flemington, and have the choice of two central
locations.
The building when completed will have 800 opera chairs, an elegant
orchestral organ, a gold fibre screen, two Powers fib picture machines
and all the latest equipments that ha%e made the H. and P. theatres so
pronounced successes.
Flemington will no doubt receive the new theatre with considerable
enthusiasm as the need of a modern house has been keenly felt. The
fact that Messrs. Hildinger and Papier consider Flemington a fertile field
for their operations speaks well for the progress of the county seat as a
theatrical centre.
The famous Paramount pictures, which are enjoying a wide popu
larity, will be shown at the Flemington playhouse as well as at the local
theatre.
Many of the Strand patrons from Lahaska, Buckingham and Carvers
ville who formerly came to Lambertville occasionally now make frequent
visits to the Doylestown playhouse. Frequent visitors from Flemington
have voiced the need of a modern and popular movie theatre, and it will
complete a chain with the Coryell’s Ferry Community as a center.
CHARLEY CHAPLIN CONTEST.
The Charley Chaplin contest will be held Monday evening, and the
boys on both sides of the river are anxiously awaiting the moment when
they can show which most resembles him. Prizes will be offered, and a
big time is expected. The full details are given in their ad on the last
page of this paper.</text>

Mr. Washington (as old Bill Thack
eray sarcastically used to call him)
could not speak for the third liberty
Loan in words, being there only in
bronze. But while Charley Chaplin
led the Twenty-second infantry band
with his slllv little cane and While
the affable and athletic Doug Fair
banks bounded lightly as a panther
from nlmost the sidewalk level to
place beside the heroic bronze legs
of General Washington—while the
crowd estimated as low as 50,000 and
as high as 100,000 listened to Doug
and Charley make speeches for the
loan -the general held a right bronze
hand gently outward, palm down, as
if to hep the attention of the appall
ing mass of humanity stretching
south in Broad street as far as the
eye could reach, east in Wall street
until humans merged with the noon
haze, west 1n Wall street until the
rear guard of that wing oi' the crowd
was belnsr Jammed into the entrances
of Old Trinity, far out on Broadway
Also the crowd spilled back into Nas
sau street so many blocKs that the
northern fringe of the Jam could not
so much as see the sub-treasury
building, where George and Doug
and Charley were facing the vast
multitude.
Described in a Ssntanea.
A great reporter on The Sun, the
late Julian Ralph, once described in a
sentence the crowd that had packed
itself in Unter den linden in Berlin
during the coronation ceremonies of
the present Kaiser Wilhelm. Whore
other correspondents took up a
column to impress upon their readers
how great was the crowd on that oc
casion Mr. Ralph said it all without
stopping for breath by remarking*
"A small German boy perched on
the low branch of a tree fell off and
broke his arm on somebody's head,
nd it took the driver of an ambu
lance exactly thirty-two minutes to
work his vehicle three-quarters of a
city block to tho spot whero tha boy
had fallen."
And that was tho kind of croyrd
that turned out yesterday at noon at
Broad and Wall streets to hear, and
especially to look upon. Doug Fair
banks and Charley Chaplin talking
bout the glories of buying Liberty
bonds.
After attending to a girl stenogra
pher who had fainted in the crush
Ambulance Surgeon Phillips of the
Broad street hospital remarked
casually that the girl he had just
revived was the eleventh case of the
kind to which he had given first aid
since taking up his station in front
of the entrance of the J. P. Morgan
& Co. offices less than three-quarters
of an hour earlier. One riian got so
jammed in the crowd that his ribs
snapped. One hundred and fifty
police reserves who tried to keep the
crowd in a semblance of order were
themselves swallowed In the onrush.
And not onlv was the asphalt pav
ed solidly from building line to build
ing line In four directions as far as
the eye could «ee, but also there were
alls of humanity reaching to the
zenith as the windows of the Bank
ers' Trust buiidine and the other
towering buildings flew up. Clerks
and stenographers and office boys,
yes and bosses too, leaned far out of
the windows up near the clouds to
get a glimpse of tho tops of the
heads of George and Charley and
Doug.
Choors From the Skylino.
And although George held his dlgni
fled pose, Doug and Charley found
time amid their speeches and acro
batics to lean far back and look
straight up into Heaven to wave and
ishout acknowledgments of the happy
cheers that came down from snowy
oints far above the timber lino of
ower Manhattan.
And when the erpeechmaking and

for the liberty loan instead of for

friends, to impress them with the

sons In New York
From The New York Sun: Doug

respectively Fairbanks and Chaplin

on a granite pedestal at the sunlit

THE FARGO FORUM, SATURDAY EVENING, APRIL 13, 1918.
Some slight sign of interest might
now be noted in the eyes of Charley
('haplin and of Doug, as each began
to realize that he was clasping |80,
000.000 to his panting bosom.
Make it $lO0.O00,000 while you're
at it. what?" cried Charley, whereup
on the sub-treasury folks, seeing that
they were beginning at last to make
some sort of dont upon the non
chalance of even Charley Chaplin,
reached toward another, shelf and
took down J40.000.000 more, 120,000,
000 for Charley and another 520,000,
00 for Doug, thus permitting ach to
hold 1100,000,000 for a few minutes.
"Oy!" cried Charlye Chaplin, un
able any' longer 'to preserve his
studied savoir faire. And he bent
his tousled head gentlv. lovingly to
one side and downward and rested
his boyish cheek fondly against the
monneh. "Oy, yol-yoi-yoi!" he croon
ed and he kissed the $100,000,000
fondly before he passed It back to the
United States of North America.
Triok Hat Stays in Vault.
Tho little party came out of tha
vaults then, Charley Chaplin bringing
up the rear. Doug Fairbanks was
the first to notice that Charley car
ried no hat with him as he passed
out of the vault. Doug called Char
ley's attention to the fact that he was
hatless.
"Sure enough!' 'cried Charley, with
every semblance of surprise. "Yea, I
must have left the little old trick hat
back there in the vault room. Doug,
you and Mr. Vogel, and all you
guards go on right up to the maU)
floor and I'll Join you as soon as I've
stepped back in the vault and found
my hat. Go on—all the guards and
everybody don't wait for me—I
couldn't think of detaining you, gen
tlemen."
But they wouldn't let Charley Chap
lin go back into the vaults to get his
hat. at least not unaccompanied. And
despite the fact that Charley's pub
licity bureau issued a screed last
night to the effect that Charley had
left his trick hat back among the
monneh quite by accident, Doug
Fairbanks was authority for the con
tradictory statement that he had seen
Charley deliberately place the trick
hat on top of $85,000,000 in a dark
corner of the vault room when no
one was looking.
Charley and Doug started out from
the Rltz-Carlton early yesterday
morning to preach to ail Manhattan
throughout the day on the text:
"First, second and third liberty
Ixjans, these three and the greatest
of these Is the third." They had Just
come from California, via Washing
ton, In their "Three Star Special,"
which was not a brand of hard liquor,
but a real train. The third of the
stars was our Mary Pickford.
"Greateat Actors in World."
All across the continent Charley
and Doug had piled off at stations
and had mingled with the throngs.

Charley Chaplin smiled a smile

smile of Doug said. "Pooh, and

plainly got sore. So feverishly they
opened one cubhv hole after another
doubling the sruard around Doug and

Doug yeTfthg above the roar of shout
ers, who did not know that young
Mr. Fairbanks was standing at theh
elbows. "Fairbanks: Bring Doug
Fairbanks out on the platform. Who'
the greatest actor In tho world? Doug
Fairbanks!"
And from the crowd pressing
around the other end of the observa
tion car the voice of Charley Chaplin
could be heard calling: shrilly, "Chap
lin! Oh, you funny Charley Chaplin
Bring out Charley Chaplin, the great
eat actor in the world!"
Both Doup and Charley were graci
ous enough to intersperse their yells
with cries for "Our Mary! Bring ou
Mary Pickford!" And when Charley
and Doug had gflt his particular
group of standees on the station plat
forms yelling hard enough for Char
ley and Doug each would crawl under
the brake beams of the car and then
sneak back into the car and stnoll out
onto their respective platforms while
the going was good.
In time they got to Washington
where President Wilson received
them last Saturday night. That was
the evening the President delivered
his important speech at Baltimore,
and although the 'Three Star Spec
lal" was an hour late at Washington
the President was gracious enough
to wait an hour overtime at the
White House until Doug and Charley
and Our Mary had got there.
"And what are you going to say in
your speeches about the third Liberty
i-oan'."' the President asked the three
movie stars.
They all thought hard and then
variously they murmured to the
President half intelligible remarks to
the effect that although they could
do fair work for the lillums they
weren't so sure of themselves as ora
tors.
"Mr. President," spoke up Doug
Fairbanks at last, "the only general
scheme I've got for a speech is to
mention your name whenever I get
stuck. That'll get a cheer every time
and while the crowd is making a lot
of noise I'll keep wraving my arms
and working my lips as if I was say
ing something. And when the noise
dies down again I'll shout, 'And, fel
low citizens, this great President
Woodrow Wilson Bingo, they'll
begin to cheer again, and I'll work
my Jaws and pound one palm with
my fist, and keep swinging my arms
until the noise dies down some more.
Then I'll shout Out your name again
—'as long as good,' as we say in the
show business."
All of which the Honorable Wood
row Wilson enjoyed immensely.
But Charley and Doug followed no
such plan once they had battled their
way knee high to the heroic bronze
legs of George Washington at Broad
and Wall streets at noon yesterday.
Charley got the crowd going first by
flipping his trick hat and then lead
ins: the khaki clad bond on the sub
tr.easury steps, and Doug, who arriv
ed a few minutes later, rendered the
office bo contingent of all the tinan
cial district speechless with ecstasy
as he vaulted to the pedestal beside
George, threw off his mustard colored
polo coat, grabbed up a little red
megaphone and led the cheers in col
lege boy fashion.

Doug Jiggles Charlay.
Charley Chaplin, when a semblance
of quiet was restored, yelled out over
the human pavement that although
British born he waa "144 per cent
American," and would be In the
trenches if it were not for a physical
disability that makes him impossible
as military material. And Doug
reached for the slim waisted little
Charley and gripped him below the
belt on the East River side while1
Charley was facing the Hudson. Then
the muscular Doug held Charley high
in the air with one hand and jiggled
him above the roaring crowd.
Doug made his speech after that,
megaphoning questions to the crowd
which enabled the roaring thousand*
to yell back resounding affirmatives
which, if the crowd meant what it
said, some day will be heard away
out in the eastern suburbs of Berlin.
And after that Lieutenant Reuterdal,
the illustrator naval officer, made a
brief speech and the movie celebrities
went Indoors to heft real money.
This morning Doug and Charley
will go to Philadelphia, where they
will meet Miss Pickford, who was
speaking in Baltimore yesterday
while the other two-thirds of the
Three Star Special" were talking
here. Then they will separate, each
to go on a separate Liberty Loan</text>
